Question:
1.) How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
what design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactis from your design approach be applied in the future work?

Answer:
1.) How I approach designing software is by trying to make it as simple and straight forward as I can. 
I used the new skills that we learned from this course.
The design process that I followed was I tried to keep every section and object together and then put some space between the new object.
I think keeping things seperated and having everything compartamentalized will be easy to follow and make corrections if there need to be any. 

Question:
2.) How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Answer:
2.) I like to take a look at the different programs and try out the programs and see which one works better for me.
Some new strategies that I tried while working on my 3D scene were to keep everything seperated. 
Doing the same code over and over again was a little annoying but I did see that doing those lines of code over and over again helped me get a better understanding of what I was writing. 
My development of coding is slightly getting better with each course. 

Question:
3.) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Answer:
3.) I think computer science plays a big part in reaching my goals. 
It taught me to use my creativity more.
